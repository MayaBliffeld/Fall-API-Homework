undefined happens when you havent added a variable or you don't assign it. 
var hello; is WRONG
hello(); is a function
hello(name1) name 1 is known as a parameter 

 x =1 
function () {
	let y = 3
	x=4
}
theses variables would only exist within this function and NOT outside of it...

$.get(url*using your url*, function(result) {})
